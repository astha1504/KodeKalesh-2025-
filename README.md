## Idea

Organizations today struggle to produce and authenticate massive volumes of digital content (text, images, media). Manual creation leads to bottlenecks, and verifying originality or ownership is nearly impossible.

**VeriCreate** automates:

1. **AI-based content generation** (text + optional images)
2. **Automatic cloud storage** (AWS S3)
3. **Integrity verification** (SHA256 hash + optional blockchain record)
4. **Ownership proof** (MetaMask signature)
